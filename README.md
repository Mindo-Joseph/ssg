## Static Site Generator

## Proposed features
1. **Generate HTML files from a data source**
- The user should be able to automatically generate HTML files from a data source, like a markdown file, json, yaml ect. 

- This should be accomplished by a cli command, like build 

2. **Documentation**
- Create and maintain proper documentation so users know how to use your static site generator

- Make sure to keep this updated as you add new features

3. **Configuration File**
- Make sure your SSG has a config file where the user is able to set global values, like site metadata, if they desire.

- Make sure there are sensible defaults in place so your ssg is 'zero configuration' worthy

4. **Run Locally**
- The user should be able to clone, fork or download your ssg and run it on their local machine

5. **Layout Functionality**
- Give the user the ability to create layouts, which can be used to wrap or nest pages within a nav, footer or more

6. **At least 4 CLI Commands**
- Create some CLI commands to make your user's life easier

    For example: serve - which starts a web server to serve the generated HTML files

7. **Add Two Custom Features**
- Add two custom features that differentiate your ssg from the rest.
